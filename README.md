Capstone Companion is a React front-end, Ruby-on-Rails (changing to .NET core) back-end CRUD app that allows a user to keep track of their coding projects!

In Capstone companion a user can:
- Create new projects with a title, description, and any additional notes for the project.
- View all projects in progress
- Edit notes on any project for later reference
- Check of completed tasks to track progress on a project
- Delete any finished or abandoned projects
- Have a handy list of key resources to help while coding projects

## Installation and Usage

The backend for this project can be found at:

- https://github.com/christopher-tero/capstone_companion_temp_backend (Ruby-on-Rails 5 backend option)
- https://github.com/christopher-tero/Capstone_Companion_NET_Backend (ASP.NET core 2.2 backend option)

It is recommended the user creates a new directory in which to download and run this file (ex. mkdir CapstoneCompanionApp).
- Navigate into directory for app

For Rails backend:
- Copy project to clipboard from github
- Clone project to app directory using "git clone <link from clipboard>"
- Navigate into folder: cd capstone_companion_temp_backend
- Start Rails server: Rails s

For .NET backend:
- Copy project to clipboard from github
- Clone project to app directory using "git clone <link from clipboard>"
- Navigate into folder: cd capstone_companion_net_backend
- Start .NET server: dotnet run

For frontend:
- Copy project to clipboard from github
- Clone project to app directory using "git clone <link from clipboard>"
- Navigate into folder: cd capstone-companion-frontend
- Make sure you have npm installed: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
- Start npm server: npm start

-------------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
